# Email-Spam-Dectecting-Model

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of an email spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models. The primary objective is to identify and filter out unwanted spam emails, ensuring that legitimate messages reach the inbox.

## Models and Accuracy
The project has evaluated several machine learning models for spam detection, with the following accuracy scores:

RandomForestClassifier: 97.59%
KNeighborsClassifier: 91.01%
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): 97.54%
MultinomialNB: 96.33%
## Usage
Data: Ensure you have a dataset containing labeled email data, with spam and non-spam categories.

Dependencies: Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including scikit-learn, NLTK (for NLP), and any other relevant dependencies.

Code: You can find the code for training and testing the models in the provided project files.

Model Selection: Choose a model based on your specific requirements, considering factors like accuracy and computational efficiency.

Training: Train the selected model using your email dataset. You can fine-tune hyperparameters and preprocessing steps to improve model performance.

Testing: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to ensure its effectiveness.
